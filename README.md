# StudyQuest: Gamified Study & Habit Tracker

## Project Description

StudyQuest is a full-stack web application designed to make studying more engaging and productive for college students. The app’s core mission is to transform academic goals into an adventure by allowing users to set study tasks, build consistent habits, and earn points to unlock levels and achievements. It combines productivity tools with collaborative features to create a supportive and motivating environment for learning.

## AI Integration

This project was developed with significant assistance from **Google AI Studio**, which served as an integrated development partner.

-   **AI Tools Used:** Google AI Studio (utilizing Gemini models).

-   **How AI Was Utilized:**
    -   **Full-Stack Code Generation:** AI was prompted to generate the entire application structure, including the React frontend, mock API services, and application state management.
    -   **Frontend Development:** All React components, pages, routing logic, and context providers (for authentication and data) were generated through iterative prompting. This included creating complex UI elements and ensuring a reactive user experience.
    -   **UI/UX Design & Styling:** The visual design, color scheme, and responsive layout were implemented using Tailwind CSS, with the AI generating the necessary classes and component structures based on descriptive prompts for a modern and intuitive interface.
    -   **Backend Logic (Mock API):** The `services/api.ts` file, which simulates a backend database and API calls, was entirely generated by the AI. This allowed for rapid prototyping and frontend development without needing to set up a separate server and database.
    -   **Prompt-Based Development:** The entire development cycle was driven by natural language prompts. Features were requested, and the AI provided the complete code, which was then tested and refined with subsequent prompts.

-   **Benefits of AI Integration:**
    -   **Speed:** The AI dramatically accelerated the development process from concept to a fully functional prototype, completing in hours what would typically take days or weeks.
    -   **Accuracy & Best Practices:** The generated code followed modern React and TypeScript best practices, including component-based architecture, state management with Context, and clear type definitions.
    -   **Feature Completeness:** AI assistance made it feasible to implement a wide range of features—from authentication and CRUD operations to real-time chat and an admin dashboard—within the tight constraints of a hackathon.

## Features

-   **Secure Authentication:** JWT-based sign-up and login with password hashing.
-   **Role-Based Access Control:** Separate access and functionalities for "User" (student) and "Admin" roles.
-   **Profile Management:** Users can edit their profile information and upload a profile picture.
-   **Task & Habit Tracking (CRUD):** Users can create, read, update, and delete their study tasks and daily/weekly habits.
-   **Gamification System:** Earn points for completing tasks and habits, track streaks, and level up. The dashboard visualizes progress with a level circle and stats.
-   **Collaborative Study Rooms:** Create public/private study rooms, join rooms using a code, and interact with other members via a real-time chat window.
-   **Productivity Tools:** A built-in Pomodoro timer on the dashboard to help users maintain focus during study sessions.
-   **Admin Panel:** An exclusive dashboard for admins to view platform statistics (total users, tasks, etc.) and manage users.
-   **Responsive UI:** A modern, clean, and fully responsive design that works on all screen sizes.

## Installation & Setup

**Using AI Studio:**
1.  The project is designed to run directly within the Google AI Studio environment.
2.  No installation is required. Simply open the project to run and test the application.

**Local Development (after exporting):**
1.  Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/studyquest-app.git
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd studyquest-app
    ```
3.  Install dependencies (assuming a Node.js environment):
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage Instructions

1.  **Login:** Use the provided mock credentials to log in as a user (`user@test.com`) or an admin (`admin@test.com`). The password for both is `password`.
2.  **Dashboard:** View your current level, points, streak, and upcoming tasks. Use the Pomodoro timer to start a focus session.
3.  **Tasks & Habits:** Navigate to the "Tasks & Habits" page to add, complete, or delete your academic to-do items.
4.  **Study Rooms:** Browse existing study rooms, create a new one, or join one with its unique code. Once inside, you can chat with other members.
5.  **Admin Panel:** If logged in as an admin, access the "Admin Panel" to see an overview of platform activity and a list of all registered users.
